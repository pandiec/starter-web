Passbook number shall be generated after entering of DS token password and before DS embossment on PDF. I believe Chandra as mentioned same thing which is correct.

Dear Vivek sir,
 
I discussed with manoranjan about the endowment passbook function he added some conditions on passbook function .
 
passbook number  will generate once DS is done .In NKDS before doing DS on click of the submit button generating passbook and pahani  pdf at run time.

Passbook number at top is coming null, ask Manoranjan
QR code is showing only one survey number but there are two survey numbers in PPB. And passbook number is not coming.
